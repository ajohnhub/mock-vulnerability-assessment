<h1>Mock Vunerabilty Assessment</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a mock vulnerability assessment report focused on identifying and addressing security risks associated with a vulnerable server within a fictional company's IT infrastructure. The report aims to illustrate the potential impact of these vulnerabilities on business operations and provide actionable recommendations to secure the server and enhance the overall security posture.

<br />
<br />
After reviewing the System Description and Scope, write a "Purpose" describing the reasons for conducting the security analysis using 3-5 sentences:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In 3-5 sentences, Explain the reasoning for the identified risks by writing an "Approach" Section:  <br/>
